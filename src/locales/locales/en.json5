		a3: 'For example: your own wallet address is A, you transfer 10 USDT to address E, but you use the transaction hash value to query, you can only query a random ledger address B (or C or D, etc.) of the service provider Transfer with E. In the same way, E cannot know whether you transferred the 10 USDT, because E can only see that the ledger address B transferred him 10 USDT.
